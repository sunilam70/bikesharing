# NYC Citibike-Analysis-
Using Tableau to visualize our analysis

Overview of Project

-Purpose


Kate and I visited NYC on vacation and used bikes extensively to move arround and see places.

We now want to create a similar biking program in our home town.

Now that Kate and I got a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors
that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders
 would like to see a bike trip analysis.


- Analysis and description of visualization

Please see below:
This image brings it all together to crate astory line of th bike usage by weekday, by gender, top starting points, checkout times

Summer months like August is the time when bike usage is the highest. Usage is most by men (males)

- Overall conclusion

In my opinion more data nees to be analysed for taking such a big business decision. We need to do a similar analysis in other months to get a complete picute.

Two additionl visualizations:
Repairs and maintaenance of bikes
Accidents,locations and their timing during the day
